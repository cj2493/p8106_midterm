## Data

clean and also only keep variables that are a numerical value (only covered numerical modeling so far)
```{r, import}
master = read_csv("./master.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(sex = factor(sex, levels = c("male", "female")),
         age = factor(age, levels = c("5-14 years", "15-24 years", "25-34 years", 
                                      "35-54 years", "55-74 years", "75+ years"))) %>%
  rename(prominent_gen = generation) %>%
  select(suicides_100k_pop, everything())

master_num = master %>%
  select(suicides_100k_pop, year, sex, age, population, hdi_for_year, gdp_for_year, gdp_per_capita) 
```


## Create x and y matrices for modeling
```{r, model_matrices}
x = model.matrix(suicides_100k_pop~., master_num)[,-1]
y = master_num$suicides_100k_pop
```
